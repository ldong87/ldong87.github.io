I'm currently a Senior Applied Scientist at Amazon developing agentic LLM application for global sellers on Amazon marketplace. My expertise lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), large language model (LLM) and generative artificial intelligence (genAI).

Before I joined Amazon, I spent two years as a Data Scientist developing machine learning models for risk management at eBay marketplace. Before my industry career, I spent one year as a Postdoctoral Fellow working on large-scale physics-based machine learning under [Omar Ghattas](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar/) and [Tan Bui](https://users.ices.utexas.edu/~tanbui/) at [Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences](https://oden.utexas.edu/), [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).

I obtained Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering advised by [Assad Oberai](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Oberai/Assad), and M.S. in Applied Mathematics advised by [Rongjie Lai](https://sites.google.com/view/rongjielai/) from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/).
